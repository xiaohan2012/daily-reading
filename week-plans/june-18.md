  - find similar papers as well as differences
  - how can we modify our problem 
- spectral graph theory: 2 lecture notes
- run multi-label experiment on big dataset
  - build the knn graph more efficiently: does sklearn support it?
  - vary graph partitioning parameters
  - vary the input graph (`k` parameter or use the co-occurence graph)
- read papers on diffusion reconstruction
  - formulation on fair cascade reconstruction
